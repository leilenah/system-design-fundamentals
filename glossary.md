## Basic Considerations
1. Architectural pieces that can be used
2. How each architectural piece works with the other pieces
3. Optimal way to use the pieces -- tradeoffs

### Distribured Systems

#### Scalability
- Ability for system to grow as demand increases.
- Horizontal scaling: add more servers
- Vertical scaling: add more power to your server (CPU, RAM, Storage, etc.)

#### Reliability
- The probability that a system will fail in a given period.
- Distributed systems are reliable if they can keep delivering services even though one or multiple hardware / software components fail.

#### Efficiency

#### Serviceability or Manageability
